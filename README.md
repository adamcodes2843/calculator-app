# FreeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries Project

## The calculator's styling was inspired by a youtube video, but I used tailwind CSS

## I created the calculator's functionality myself with no walkthrough

### Definitely can make the code more presentable and professional in the future

It works pretty well, which is awesome, but in the future I might edit the calculator if/else if functions into a switch/case statement or use a useReducer hook.
