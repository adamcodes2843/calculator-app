# FreeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries Calculator Project

## Project Demo: https://adamcodes2843.github.io/calculator-app/

The calculator's styling was inspired by a youtube video, but I used tailwind CSS

I created the calculator's functionality myself with no walkthrough. I can definitely make the code more presentable and professional in the future. It works pretty well, which is awesome, but I might edit the calculator if/else if functions into a switch/case statement or use a useReducer hook.
